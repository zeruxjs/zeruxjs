## Select the driver

The default adapter uses node-redis. Choose ioredis explicitly when needed. The manager owns a client it creates; injected clients remain caller-owned unless `ownClient: true` is set.

```ts
import { createCacheManager } from '@zeruxjs/cache';
const cache = await createCacheManager({
  helper: '@zeruxjs/cache-redis', prefix: 'shop:catalog',
  options: { url: process.env.REDIS_URL }
});
await cache.set('product:1', { stock: 5 }, { ttlSeconds: 30 });
await cache.close();
```

## Clearing safely

Namespaces are literal, including Redis glob metacharacters. Namespace deletion scans and deletes bounded batches, not a snapshot transaction; writers can repopulate keys while clearing. FLUSHDB is disabled by default. Explicit global clearing belongs only on a dedicated database with a reviewed policy.

## Counters and writes

Redis conditional SET NX/XX and integer operations provide provider-level atomicity for one key. A multi-key cache write is not a cross-key transaction. Do not overwrite an integer counter with an incompatible JSON/string representation and then assume increment still works.

## Cluster and queue integration

Injected ioredis Cluster clients scan master shards and use per-key operations to avoid cross-slot multi-key commands. Cluster FLUSHDB is not available. Use the queue package's Cluster connection helper for BullMQ and never set ioredis keyPrefix for BullMQ connections. Keep cache and queue namespaces distinct.

## Operations

Use TLS/ACL credentials, bounded timeouts and isolated namespaces. Decide whether a cache outage may degrade an application or must block startup. Monitor errors; error listeners avoid unhandled EventEmitter failures but do not make failed reads successful. Close only resources the application owns.
