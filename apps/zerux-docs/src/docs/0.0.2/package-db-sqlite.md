## Driver choice

```ts
import { createConnector } from '@zeruxjs/db-sqlite';
const connector = await createConnector({
  filename: './private/app.sqlite', driver: 'node'
});
await connector.disconnect();
```

`driver` accepts node, better-sqlite3 or auto. With no filename the connection is in memory. The native driver requires a Node runtime supporting node:sqlite; opening/permission errors are surfaced rather than disguised as a fallback. Install the optional better-sqlite3 peer only if selecting that driver.

## Supported operations

Prepared statements support SELECT, writes and supported RETURNING statements. The framework truncate operation becomes DELETE FROM. SQLite does not support CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABASE or USE; those operations reject.

## Native transactions

Use `getNativeConnection()` for advanced SQLite APIs. With synchronous drivers, do not put an await between BEGIN and COMMIT: unrelated work can interleave on a shared connection. An array of JSON operations is not a transaction.

## Backup and restoration

`createSqliteConsistentBackup(native, absoluteDestination)` uses the Node live-backup interface, checks integrity and refuses an existing destination. Stop writers before restoration and test the verified copy at a new location. Do not copy an active WAL database as though the main file were a complete snapshot. Protect backup files and keep copies outside the serving host.

## Ownership

Injected databaseInstance values are not closed by the adapter. Connector-created databases close on disconnect. A local SQLite file is not a distributed database for independent filesystem hosts.
